                4. The Benefits of Cellaring and Growing Older
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These wines reward patience and offer a look into the past, encapsulating the essence of their vintage. They range from the refinement of aged Bordeaux to the opulence of aged Barolo.
